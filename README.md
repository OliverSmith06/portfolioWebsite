# Welcome

Hi! My name is Oliver and I'm a software engineer. My goal with this project was to create a website that would act as my resume. 
I find that as a software engineer, there is no better resume to show my skills then a website that I've created!

Note: I have sunset this website in favour for a new, more concise personal site that I'm currently working on at https://github.com/OliverSmith06/personal-site (Heavy WIP)

## Launching Locally

If you want to build my website locally, you can go ahead by cloning/downloading this repo, hopping in the project directory and running:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Viewing

However, if you just want to take a look a the website and have no interest in
building it yourself you can head to (~~~~~)
